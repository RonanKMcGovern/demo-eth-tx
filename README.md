# Calling on a cryptokitty smart contract

Right now it's unclear whether the abi I have set up is correct. I have based it on the getKitty function, which seems to be a method.

Moving forward I'll try to learn how to call in a different way.

Trying to just paste the abi from etherscan isn't working either.
